## Introduction

To develop ATR locally, we manage dependencies using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). To run ATR on ASF hardware, we run it in containers managed by Puppet, but since this guide is about development, we focus on using uv.

## Get the source

[Fork the source code](https://github.com/apache/tooling-trusted-releases/fork) of [ATR on GitHub](https://github.com/apache/tooling-trusted-releases), and then [clone your fork locally](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).

There are lots of files and directories in the root of the ATR Git repository. The most important thing to know is that `atr/` contains the source code. ATR is a Python application based on [ASFQuart](https://github.com/apache/infrastructure-asfquart), which is based on [Quart](https://github.com/pallets/quart). The Quart web framework is an asynchronous version of [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask), a very widely used synchronous web framework. In addition to Python, we use small amounts of JavaScript and TypeScript for the front end.

## Install dependencies

To run ATR locally after cloning the source, you will need to install the following dependencies:

* [cmark](https://github.com/commonmark/cmark) (optional; for rebuilding documentation)
* Any [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) compliant [make](https://frippery.org/make/)
* [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert)
* [Python 3.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3138/)
* [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation)

You can install Python 3.13 through your package manager or through uv. Here is how to install these dependencies on [Alpine Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_Linux):

```shell
apk add cmark curl git make mkcert@testing
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | env UV_INSTALL_DIR="/usr/local/bin" sh
uv python install 3.13
```

For macOS these instructions become:

```shell
brew install cmark mkcert
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
rehash
uv python install 3.13
```

ATR should work in any POSIX style environment.

## Run the server

Then, to run the server:

```shell
cd tooling-trusted-releases/
mkdir state
make certs-local
make serve-local
```

The `certs-local` step runs `mkcert localhost.apache.org localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1` to generate a locally trusted TLS certificate. If the certificate is not trusted, you may have to follow the [mkcert guide](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert/blob/master/README.md) to resolve the issue.

ATR requires TLS even for development because login is performed through the actual ASF OAuth server. This way, the development behavior aligns closely with the production behavior. We try to minimize differences between development and production environments.

## Load the site

ATR will then be served on various hosts, but we recommend using only `localhost.apache.org`. This requires adding an entry to your `/etc/hosts` and potentially restarting your DNS server. If you do this, the following link should work:

[`https://localhost.apache.org:8080/`](https://localhost.apache.org:8080/)

If you do not want to change your `/etc/hosts`, you can use `127.0.0.1`. You should not use `localhost`. The following link should work:

[`https://127.0.0.1:8080/`](https://127.0.0.1:8080/)

Pick one or the other, because logging into the site on one host does not log you in to the site on any other host.

It will take one or two minutes for the server to fetch committee and project information from the ASF website. Until the fetch is complete, no existing committees and projects will show.

Developers without LDAP credentials will be unable to perform `rsync` writes and certain tasks may also fail. To enable these actions to succeed, visit `/user/cache` and press the "Cache me!" button. This writes your session information to the ATR state directory, where it will be consulted instead of an LDAP lookup if it exists. The same page also allows you to clear your session cache data. When you clear your session cache data, the `atr/principal.py` module will still likely cache your authorization, so you need to restart the server to clear that. This session caching feature only works in debug mode, which is enabled when using `make serve-local`.
