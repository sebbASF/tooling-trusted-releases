# Governance

This document describes the governance model for Apache Trusted Releases (ATR).

## Project Status

ATR is developed by **ASF Tooling**, an initiative of the Apache Software Foundation rather than a top-level project (TLP). This means ATR follows the development processes and governance structure of Tooling.

> **Note:** As of January 2026, this code is available for internal ASF feedback only. The project is in alpha development and subject to significant changes.

## ASF Tooling

ASF Tooling is an ASF initiative launched in 2025, responsible for:

- Streamlining development across the ASF
- Automating repetitive tasks
- Reducing technical debt
- Enhancing collaboration throughout the ASF

## Decision Making

*TODO: Document the decision-making process for ATR.*
