**Instructions for prospective contributors:** <!-- markdownlint-disable-line MD041 -->

Thank you for your offer to help with ATR! We require new contributors who are not existing ASF committers to send a message of introduction to our development mailing list.

Please follow these instructions carefully:

1. Send an empty message to [dev-subscribe@tooling.apache.org](mailto:dev-subscribe@tooling.apache.org)

2. Reply to the automated response to subscribe

3. Send a message to [dev@tooling.apache.org](mailto:dev@tooling.apache.org) introducing yourself. Your message must also contain the last ten lines of output from ATR pre-commit checks, and the last ten lines of output from the e2e tests

_These instructions do not apply to trivial changes such as bug fixes or the correction of typographical errors. They do, however, apply to any substantial documentation changes._

We **only accept PRs that have been linted and tested**. You will need to run and test ATR in order to contribute. Please see the following guides:

* [How to run the ATR server](https://release-test.apache.org/docs/running-the-server)
* [How to run ATR pre-commit checks](https://release-test.apache.org/docs/how-to-contribute#pull-request-workflow)
* [How to run and create ATR tests](https://release-test.apache.org/docs/running-and-creating-tests#running-end-to-end-tests)

You must mark your PR as a draft until it is ready for review. You must use the rebase strategy to keep your PR up to date with the `main` branch. Please follow everything in the [contribution guide](https://release-test.apache.org/docs/how-to-contribute) and the [code conventions](https://release-test.apache.org/docs/code-conventions).

Thank you again for the offer of contribution. We hope that these requirements and the volume of reading will not deter you from contributing. ATR is used to bolster supply chain security, so we put these procedures in place to help to ensure a high quality of contributions. If you have any problems following these instructions, please [open a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/apache/tooling-trusted-releases/issues/new?template=BLANK_ISSUE).
